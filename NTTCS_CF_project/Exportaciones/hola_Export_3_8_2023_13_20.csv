?	IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity and privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for data management.

?	IT/cybersecurity personnel conduct annual penetration testing on network segments hosting High Value Assets (HVAs).
Vulnerability & Patch Management (VPM) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
?	An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, categorizes devices according to the data the asset stores, transmits and/ or processes and applies the appropriate technology controls to protect the asset and data.
?	A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function:
o	Defines the scope of ASM activities.
o	Provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity and privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization?s applications, systems, services and data with regards to ASM.
o	Provides oversight of ASM activities to centrally manage the flaw remediation process as part of the organization?s overall Patch& Vulnerability & Patch Management Program (VPMP). 
?	A Security Operations Center (SOC), or similar function:
o	Manages the identification, tracking and remediation of vulnerabilities.
o	Utilizes a Security Incident Event monitor (SIEM), or similar automated tool, to monitor for unauthorized activities, accounts, connections, devices and software according to organization-specific Indicators of Compromise (IoC), including feeds from applications, hosts, network devices and vulnerability scanners.
?	Asset custodians install the latest stable version of security-related updates on all systems within the organization-defined time requirements. 
?	Cybersecurity personnel conduct annual penetration testing on network segments hosting High Value Assets (HVAs).
Vulnerability & Patch Management (VPM) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
? 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
? 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
? 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
? 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
? 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
? 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.

?	Administrative processes and technologies focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed (e.g., Demilitarized Zones (DMZs)).
?	Internet-facing technologies are configured to protect data with the strength and integrity commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information and mostly conform to industry-recognized standards for hardening (e.g., DISA STIGs, CIS Benchmarks or OEM security guides), including cryptographic protections for sensitive/regulated data.

?
