?	IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity and privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for data management.

?	A manual data retention process exists.
?	Content filtering blocks users from performing ad hoc file transfers through unapproved file transfer services (e.g., Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.).
?	Mobile Device Management (MDM) software is used to restrict and protect the data that resides on mobile devices.
?	Physical controls, administrative processes and technologies focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed.
